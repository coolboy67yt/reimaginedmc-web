# Who brought the TNT?
A plugin built into PaperMC, called "Spark" is loading twice and causing the server to crash.
We are in the process of fixing it, though all possible fixes seem impossible with minefort's
hosting. Minefort support team has been contacted, though it is unknown when they could respond.

We are sorry for these issues. You can join ReReImaginedMC.minefort.com in the meantime. It does
not have the gamemodes of the regular server, but it's just a place for our community to come
together and wait for these troubles to be over. Again, we're sorry. Though at the same time,
it's not our fault. Minefort sucks!
