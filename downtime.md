# It's happenin'.
-# @everyone
After some work, I have grabbed the latest versions of all the plugins we need. However, it's not that simple. :cb_cry:

## So what is happening?
If you don't know, we're in the process of updating the server to 1.21. You can see the post [above](https://canary.discord.com/channels/1298796783798976532/1298798530516750410/1301043889267802194) for more info.

## Downtime Info
We're not sure how long it's gonna be down, but it's going to be offline for a bit while we upload/replace the necessary files. For a short period, it will be whitelist-only, so we can fix all the game-breaking bugs we need to fix before we can release publicly again.

The update will start at <t:1730331000:f> (don't worry, the text will adjust to your timezone when you read it.)

For now, just keep on playing. We'll shut down <t:1730331000:R>. See ya in 1.21!
